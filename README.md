Tasks for Artificial Intelligence

Ciara is looking for employees for her new company, which develops and provides AI based logistic software for retailers. Ciara has determined that she needs:

2 Python Programmers, 2 AI Engineers, 1 Web Designer, 1 Database Admin, and 1 Systems Engineer.
Assume that if a person has two abilities, he or she can take on two roles in the company.

So Ciara narrowed down her selections to the following people:

Name 	Abilities
Peter 	Python and AI
Juan 	Web and AI
Jim 	AI and Systems
Jane 	Python and Database
Mary 	Web and Systems
Bruce 	Systems and Python
Anita 	Web and AI

Scenario 1:

Suppose Ciara knows Python, and only has funds to hire three more people.

Scenario 2:

Suppose Ciara and Juan become partners, with the additional funds they can now employ four more people but must employ another AI Engineer, so they need 2 Python Programmers, 3 AI Engineers, 1 Web Designer, 1 Database Admin, and 1 Systems Engineer.
